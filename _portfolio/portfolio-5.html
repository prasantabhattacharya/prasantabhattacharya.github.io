Through this set of projects we try to analyze large scale data on anonymized search logs and user queries on Q&A platforms to understand how users search for information online to accomplish specific tasks. Re-visiting online search through the lens of search tasks can lead to the design of task-aware platforms which can offer better personalization, ad targeting and task-aware ranking of search results. <br><br>
