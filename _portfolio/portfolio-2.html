Financial exclusion is a crippling social problem in many countries, and the lack of adequate data-backed strategies make it extremely hard for microfinance institutions to operate within acceptable delinquency rates.
My collaborators and I work with important microfinance stakeholders in the region to explore novel data-driven approaches of performing creditworthiness assessment in an effective yet privacy-conscious manner.
Such approaches can empower microfinance institutions in lowering default rates and improving the overall sustainability of microfinance communities. <br>
