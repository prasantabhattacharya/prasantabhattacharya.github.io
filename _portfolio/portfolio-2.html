Low financial literacy and financial exclusion is a crippling social problem in many countries, and the lack of adequate data-backed strategies makes it challenging for small and medium-sized financial institutions to create value in these markets.
In the past, my collaborators and I have collaborated with microfinance stakeholders in the region to explore novel data-driven approaches of performing creditworthiness assessment using effective, explainable and privacy-preserving methods.
Such approaches can empower microfinance institutions in lowering default rates and improving the overall sustainability of microfinance communities, while also contributing to social welfare. In more recent projects, I have partnered with a major financial literacy organization to
design data-informed strategies for enhancing financial confidence and intention among learners. <br><br>
