Understanding human emotions is fundamental to our daily interactions. While emotions are quite intuitively understood by humans, it is rather tricky to train machines to understand emotions under naturalistic conditions. 
My collaborators and I work on building and validating computational models to emotion detection and analyses. As part of our research in socially intelligent systems at IHPC, we have developed capabilities to perform fine-grained emotion detection from various kinds of textual, speech as well as visual expressions.
Such large scale emotion data is extremely valuable in a variety of social and business contexts *(e.g. design of empathetic chatbots, predicting popularity of online video ads, performing quality assessment of customer service interactions etc.)* <br><br>

<u>Recent update</u>: "Digital Emotions" at IHPC (A*STAR), was a finalist at IET Innovation Awards 2018, "Intelligent Systems" category (IETs annual Innovation Awards recognize
the best in new innovations in science, engineering and technology) <br>
