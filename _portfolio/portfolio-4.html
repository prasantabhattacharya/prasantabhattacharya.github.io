Understanding human emotions is fundamental to our daily interactions. While emotions are quite intuitively understood by humans, it is rather tricky to train machines to understand emotions under naturalistic conditions. 
My collaborators and I work on building and validating computational models to emotion detection and analyses. Within my research group at IHPC, we have developed capabilities to perform fine-grained emotion detection from various kinds of textual, speech as well as visual expressions.
Such large scale emotion data is extremely valuable in a variety of social and business contexts *(e.g. design of empathetic chatbots, predicting popularity of online video ads, performing quality assessment of customer service interactions etc.)*
