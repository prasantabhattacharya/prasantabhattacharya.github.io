Thank you for visiting my personal webpage.


I am currently a Research Scientist with the Social and Cognitive Computing Department at the Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC), one of the flagship interdisciplinary research institutes at [A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/), a leading science, tech and research organisation in Singapore. As of Jan 2019, I have a second appointment as an Adjunct Assistant Professor at the [NUS Business School](https://bschool.nus.edu.sg/) ([Dept. of Analytics and Operations](https://bschool.nus.edu.sg/analytics-operations)) where I will be designing and teaching a new graduate module on network science and analytics.

My current research primarily draws on three broad areas:

i. Analyzing user behavior on large social networks using fine-grained observational data, and understanding the interplay between network and user behavior in a variety of sectors spanning finance, healthcare, education and urban systems. (Skim through [this](https://economics.mit.edu/files/7781) and [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14753) for two very interesting examples)

ii. Building computational models of human emotions on digital platforms, and exploring novel applications of large-scale and fine-grained emotion data e.g. empathetic chatbots. Did you know that there could be [as many as 27 distinct types](http://www.pnas.org/content/114/38/E7900) of quantifiable emotional experiences?

iii. Causal inference modeling of large scale observational data. This is particularly important in the context of impact evaluation studies where randomized experiments are not feasible to conduct. See [this](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub41854) for a good example of when this is *super* important.

I have over 6 years of academic and industry experience in solving complex social and business problems using social network analyses, causal inference, and behavioral analytics approaches. My pool of research problems span digital marketing, FinTech and EdTech contexts in Asia. I have worked extensively with leading industry partners in digital media, social networks, healthcare, microfinance and online search industries. Through these research collaborations, I try to offer insights that not only enrich our understanding of how users behave on emerging platforms, but also deliver solutions to tricky social and business problems.
