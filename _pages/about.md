Thank you for visiting my personal webpage.


I am currently a Research Scientist with the Social and Cognitive Computing Department at the Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC), one of the flagship interdisciplinary research institutes at [A*STAR]({https://www.a-star.edu.sg/}), a leading science, tech and research organisation in Singapore. My work here primarily draws on three research directions:

i. Analyzing online user behavior on large social networks using fine-grained observational data, and understanding the interplay between network and user behavior in a variety of sectors spanning finance, healthcare, education and urban systems. 
ii. Building and validating computational models of human emotions on digital platforms, and exploring novel social and business applications of large-scale and fine-grained emotion data e.g. empathetic chatbots. 
iii. Causal inference modeling of large scale observational data. This is particularly important in the context of impact evaluation studies where randomized experiments are not feasible to conduct. See Brodersen et al. for a good example.

I have over 6 years in academic and industry experience in solving complex social and business problems using social network, causal inference, and behavioral analytics approaches. My pool of research problems span digital marketing, FinTech and EdTech contexts in Asia. I have worked extensively with leading industry partners in digital media, social networks, healthcare, microfinance and online search industries. Through these research collaborations, I try to offer insights that not only enrich our understanding of how users behave on emerging platforms, but also deliver solutions to tricky social and business problems.
